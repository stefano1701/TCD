2,3,Man,Yes,49,7,Yes,14,I think an interesting question to explore when people are thinking about hybrid working is to what extent they consider the good of the company rather than their own desires.  My experience is that people want to work at home a lot for their own sakes but rarely consider other people/what is best for the company.  Q2 is difficult to answer.  The company policy is that we do hybrid working and it is left to managers to decide what that means for their teams.  For my team I have decided at least two days a week in the office - hence the answer I have given.
5,3,Woman,Yes,39,9,Yes,0,"Would be good to capture employers who (as mine does) has no official no. of days for hybrid working, is at discretion of each team. "

3,2,Man,No,34,6,Yes,0,Ideally would want 2.5 days WFH (I used to love the 2/3 fortnightly cycle before company policy changed to 3-days in) but slightly leaned towards 3 over 2 for Q1.
2,2,Man,No,34,7,Yes,0,"There is (apparently) a split within the senior leadership of my company about hybrid working. Apparently at least one (thr CEO) wants 5 day in office but others want less. So I view the current arrangements as volatile - a change in that team could quickly change the policy. The current policy is good for me, but I do worry that it is not good for professional development of junior staff - particularly graduates."

4,3,Woman,Yes,46,10,No,4,Ideally I’d like to wfh 3.5 days a week ie 3 days one week and 4 days the next. Wfh has saved my career as I don’t think I could have managed the commute with the menopause issues I’ve had over the last 5 years. My kids are 10 and 14 but if they were younger I’d want 4 days a week wfh. I notice that your survey doesn’t take into account part time work. Perhaps you should state people should put full time equivalent if tehy work part time? I moved roles in the summer and turned down interviews with companies that required more than 2 days in the office a week. Companies that are stricter on wfh are going to struggle with diversity.

1,2,Man,No,54,8,No,3,"Hi Michael, Some of your questions don’t cover RSA Corporate Actuarial. We are required to do 6 days in a 4 week period so 1.5 days per week. However, this isn’t enforced and some still only do 1 or 2 days a month. I do 4 or 5 days a week in office mainly to interact with other teams. My role as a Director as Head of Actuarial Function means I have a team in India not U.K. so my time in office is interacting with Risk, UW, Claims, Pricing etc. I feel RSA should mandate more days in office for Actuarial. As said we are 1.5 days pw but most other functions are now mandated at 3 days pw and this is enforced unlike with us. Think we are too lenient but people have got used to WFH and helps with family life. When discussed jobs elsewhere in last year most other actuarial employers are minimum 3 days pw so surprising RSA so low."
4,4,Man,No,35,10,Yes,15,
3,3,Woman,Yes,38,10,Yes,3,Our company guide is 2 days a week in the office but this is routinely not followed. In practice it’s fine and works for me but it’s interesting to consider official rules vs. what is actually enforced.

I believe we lose a lot from being fully remote but having set it up in the pandemic I'm now stuck with it.  I believe that the younger people especially should come into the office daily or near-daily: we have a generation who are not going to learn either soft skills or by osmosis.

4,3,Man,Yes,46,9,Yes,20,"Hi, I work in London but live in Scotland so I have been hybrid working since 2007. Pre pandemic I used to do 3DPWK in London and WFH 2 DPWK. Post pandemic I have been going down to london much less, maybe averaging once every 3 or 4 weeks. I therefore chose the 4DPWK option in question 1, as that is my ""average"" over time. It would be really interesting to see if you get any themes from people who want to WFH more, or less. I've always felt that actuarial careers rely a lot on learning on the job, which in turn needs quite a lot of interaction between more, and less, experienced people. I do worry that students are missing out on ""informal"" learning by being around more senior folk."

I think the London Market has centred to around 3 days in the office, and if anything is increasing rather than decreasing - which I'm enthused by. I feared moving to a virtual world would have extremely bad outcomes for the quality of actuarial work, peoples mental health etc There are some exceptions - family care being the primary one.  "
